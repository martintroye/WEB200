            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <p>After college I applied and was accepted into the Peace Corps. I was stationed in Benin Africa from June of 2016 to August of 2018. In Benin I lived in a small village in the northern part of the country and taught the equivalent of middle school English. While in Benin I participated or organized several community projects such as: hand washing stations at the school, a mural of the globe painted on a school wall, English club, regional teacher training and sponsoring events to empower young women in the community. 
                    For more information on the Peace Corps or Benin here are a couple of helpful sites.
